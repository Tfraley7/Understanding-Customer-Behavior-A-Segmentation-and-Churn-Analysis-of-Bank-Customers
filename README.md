# Understanding-Customer-Behavior-A-Segmentation-and-Churn-Analysis-of-Bank-Customers
In this project, I will analyze a bank marketing dataset from Kaggle using Pandas and Matplotlib to segment customers based on their demographics, behavior, and preferences. I will use this segmentation to improve marketing strategy and customer engagement, with the goal of increasing customer retention and revenue.
